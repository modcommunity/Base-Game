This is our first **fully open-source** game that will display the power of open source and modding **like never seen before**!

This game will act as a base for many mods, game modes, and more. This is the reason the game doesn't have any particular name. However, if anything, it's going to be a true "sandbox" game.

## Our Mission
The goal of this game is to allow users to easily create mods and game servers using future open-source modding tools such as the following that integrate into [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). With the power of open-source, mod creators and server owners will have **full control** over their mods, game modes, and server configuration.

* Mapping Tool - For creating maps.
* Model Tool - For creating 3D models.
* Texture Tool - For creating textures, etc.

* Automatic Downloads - Allow users to securely and easily download custom content from the game server before connecting automatically.
* Multi-Threaded Server Software - Fully multi-threaded server software for server and community owners to host game servers with. Host servers and game modes with over thousands of users in-game at once!

The modding tools will essentially be a higher-level version of the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). This is why they'll be geared towards simplicity and user navigation. However, complex features will still be available and you'll still be able to use the Godot Engine itself due to everything being **open source**!

**Note** - We will also support conversions from already popular tools such as Blender. In fact, Godot likely already supports this.

## Truly Cross-Platform
This game will be **truly cross-platform**! You will be able to play **online**, with anybody regardless of platform, using following!

* Web browsers - HTML 5.
* Desktop applicationa - Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.
* Mobile applications - Android, iOS, etc.
* Consoles - Xbox, Playstation, etc.

We will be accomplishing true cross-platform support by implementing network code that allows users to specify one of two network protocols, [TCP](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol). The user and server will send and receive data on the specific socket for that protocol. This'll allow users to play with each other using different network protocols and allows for true cross-platform support. For example, web browsers use TCP and do not natively support UDP whereas many games only utilize UDP. 

**Note** - There will likely be a process on getting our game publicly listed on the consoles themselves when done.

## [The Bigger Picture](https://moddingcommunity.com/about)
We are currently working on a mod marketplace and global discovery browsers for game communities and servers. We will be allowing users to submit both free/open-source (encouraged) or paid mods along with adding their own communities and servers. We are supporting as many external games and platforms as we can for this such as Minecraft, Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto, Halo, Rust, Discord, and so much more! Additionally, our platform will act modular and universal in the sense that all content creators and game companies will be able to easily integrate into systems we will be creating in the future such as our unique **match-making**, arcade, points, and leaderboard systems!

Our goal in the future is to allow users to easily install mods for their game's client or server with one click of a button via a launcher tool that supports both clients and servers. Our marketplace will act as a **workshop** for any mod or game mode. With that said, our server and community browser provides its owners with some useful functionality and also supports loading into game servers through the web browser via HTML 5 games.

If you combine everything we've said above, you have a [website](https://moddingcommunity.com/) where users will be able to easily connect to modded game servers running essentially their own **game modes**!
