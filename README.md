This is our first **fully open-source** game that will display the power of open source and modding **like never seen before**!

This game will act as a base for many mods, game modes, and more. This is the reason the game doesn't have any particular name. However, if anything, it's going to be a true "sandbox" game.

Additionally, we want a fully modular and universal system where each piece of the game (such as the modding tools below), may be used in any other game using Godot Engine (or other supported engines in the future).

## Road Map
*To Be Continued...*

## Contributing
We are looking for help from the open-source community! Please view our road map and join our Discord [server](https://discord.moddingcommunity.com/) if you have any questions or want to chat with the community!

## Our Mission
The goals of this game and others we help with are to allow users to easily create mods and game servers using future open-source modding tools such as the following that integrate into the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). With the power of open-source, mod creators and server owners will have **full control** over their mods, game modes, and server configurations.

* Mapping Tool - For creating maps.
* Model Tool - For creating 3D models.
* Texture Tool - For creating textures, etc.

* Automatic Downloads - Allow users to securely and easily download custom content from the game server before connecting automatically.
* Multi-Threaded Server Software - Fully multi-threaded server software for server and community owners to host game servers with. Host servers and game modes with over thousands of users in-game at once!

The modding tools will essentially be a higher-level version of the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). This is why they'll be geared towards simplicity and user navigation. However, complex features will still be available and you'll still be able to use the Godot Engine itself due to everything being **open source**!

**Note** - We will also support conversions from already popular tools such as Blender. In fact, Godot likely already supports this.

## Truly Cross-Platform
This game *and other games we help with* will be **truly cross-platform**! You will be able to play **online**, with anybody regardless of platform, using the following!

* Web browsers - HTML 5 (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
* Desktop applicationa - Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.
* Mobile applications - Android, iOS, etc.
* Consoles - Xbox, Playstation, etc.

We will be accomplishing true cross-platform support by implementing network code that allows users to specify one of two network protocols, [TCP](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol). The user and server will send and receive data on the specific socket for that protocol. This'll allow users to play with each other using different network protocols and allows for true cross-platform support. For example, web browsers use TCP and do not natively support UDP whereas many games only utilize UDP. 

**Note** - There will likely be a process on getting our game publicly listed on the consoles themselves when done.

## [The Bigger Picture](https://moddingcommunity.com/about)
We are currently working on a mod marketplace and global discovery browsers for game communities and servers. We will be allowing users to submit both free/open-source (encouraged) or paid mods along with adding their own communities and servers. We are supporting as many external games and platforms as we can for this such as Minecraft, Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto, Halo, Rust, Discord, and so much more! Additionally, our platform will act modular and universal in the sense that all content creators and game companies will be able to easily integrate into systems we will be creating in the future such as our unique **match-making**, arcade, points, and leaderboard systems!

Our goal in the future is to allow users to easily install mods for their game's client or server with one click of a button via a launcher tool that supports both clients and servers. Our marketplace will act as a **workshop** for any mod or game mode. With that said, our server and community browser provides its owners with some useful functionality and also supports loading into game servers through the web browser via HTML 5 games.

If you combine everything we've said above, you have a [website](https://moddingcommunity.com/) where users will be able to easily connect to modded game servers running essentially their own **game modes**! With that said, we have a forum where users will be able to post guides, tutorials, ask for help, and more! We will be maintaining modding tools that allow users to easily create content for their mods, game modes, or game servers!

We will also be displaying how powerful multiplayer and game servers are with modding! Unfortunately, modded game servers are not known enough. If you want to see one out of millions of examples of modded game servers, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW4EhWVaxVw) of an old Counter-Strike: Source Zombie Escape server. The map (Lord Of The Rings), game mode (Zombie Escape), models (Zombies), and more were all made by **the community** (for *free*!). The game itself was made by [Valve/Steam](http://valvesoftware.com/).

Once done, this will **easily** positively change the direction of gaming! Instead of paying money for games where companies couldn't care less about their community or the game itself, we will have multiple, fully open-source and moddable games (including this one) with communities creating custom content to keep the community and game alive!

## F.A.Q.
### What Is A Mod?
Mod, in our case, stands for *modification*. However, the definition of mod is often mixed leading to confusion. The most popular definition is a third-party modification to a video game from the community. Usually for free, but platforms do support paid mods.

What's even more confusing is technically many games are "mods" because they use existing game engines such as [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) (they're technically modding the engine).

### Is This Unique?
We haven't found any projects that have fully accomplished the above. Community and modded game servers are still not popular enough in gaming and modding in general has been on a decline for ages on many games, especially multiplayer driven.

### There's Another Project That Has The Same Goal
If there are other projects with the same goals and missions as us, we'd love to collaborate as long as everybody is on the same page! Please feel free to join our Discord [server](https://discord.moddingcommunity.com/) or [email](mailto://modcommunity.business@gmail.com) us!
